# Installation

### Windows
1. Download and extract this: https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/archive/injector.zip
2. Rename `BetterDiscordApp-injector` to `app`.
3. Go to `%localappdata%\Discord\`, and locate the directory with the largest version number (e.g. `app-0.0.306`).
4. Within `app-0.0.306` navigate to `resources`.
5. If an `app` folder already exists inside `resources`, delete it.
6. Move the `app` folder (the one you downloaded and renamed) inside of `resources`.
7. Fully quit Discord and restart it.
